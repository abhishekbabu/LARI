# LARI - Laboratory Reconciliation and Information System
A Java implementation of the LARI application for UW AFSL.

## Managing the future of AFSL
The LARI program is going to replace the multitude of Excel spreadsheets that allow AFSL to run and function properly.

### Rules and Guidelines
- Make sure all methods, classes and fields are fully documented with Javadoc style comments (even if they're private!)
\- it's good practice.
- If a method is complicated, write inline comments that describe why things are being done the way they're done so
that everyone else can understand it.
- Make sure you set your IDE (preferably IntelliJ) to indent with 4 spaces instead of a tab character.
- If there is extra work to be done in your portion of the code, write an inline comment describing the remaining work
in the following format: `// TODO: ...`.
- Make sure there is a user story on Trello corresponding to the work you are doing. If not, tell the lead software
engineer.
- Do not commit to **master**. I will personally revert any commits you make to master. Create a new feature branch for
each user story you work on and commit your work to that branch. When you are done with that branch, make sure it works
and then create a pull request to have it merged to master. I will resolve any conflicts and merge your branch to
master.

### Notes and Setup Information
Consult the `\LARI\notes` directory for information about setting up your IDE and the general workflow.
